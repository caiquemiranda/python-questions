71. What is the purpose of the `__str__` and `__repr__` methods in a Python class?

- [ ] `__str__` is used for string representation for end-users, while `__repr__` is used for developers and debugging
- [ ] `__str__` is used for developers and debugging, while `__repr__` is used for string representation for end-users
- [ ] `__str__` and `__repr__` are identical methods used interchangeably
- [ ] `__str__` converts objects to strings, while `__repr__` converts strings to objects

72. Write a Python function that uses the `reduce()` function from the `functools` module to find the product of all numbers in a list.

73. What does the `@property` decorator do in Python classes?

- [ ] It makes class attributes private and inaccessible
- [ ] It allows a method to be accessed like an attribute without calling it with parentheses
- [ ] It creates static class methods that can be called without creating an instance
- [ ] It prevents a class attribute from being modified after it's set

74. Create a context manager using the `with` statement to open a file, read its contents, and automatically close it.

---

75. What is the output of the following code?
```python
class Test:
    count = 0
    def __init__(self):
        Test.count += 1
        
t1 = Test()
t2 = Test()
print(Test.count)
```

- [ ] 0
- [ ] 1
- [ ] 2
- [ ] Error

76. What is duck typing in Python?

- [ ] A way to check if an object is of a specific type
- [ ] A way to convert one data type to another
- [ ] A programming concept where the type or class of an object is less important than the methods it defines
- [ ] A method for handling errors in type conversions

77. Write a Python function that uses a list comprehension with a conditional statement to create a list of even numbers squared from a range of numbers.

---

78. What is the difference between `.append()` and `.extend()` methods when working with lists in Python?

- [ ] `.append()` adds a single element to the list, while `.extend()` adds multiple elements from an iterable
- [ ] `.extend()` adds a single element to the list, while `.append()` adds multiple elements from an iterable
- [ ] `.append()` adds elements at the beginning of the list, while `.extend()` adds elements at the end
- [ ] They are the same, just with different names

---

79. Create a function that uses the `zip()` function to combine two lists into a dictionary, where items from the first list are keys and items from the second list are values.

---

80. What is a Python module? Select all that apply.

- [ ] A file containing Python code that can be imported and used in other Python programs
- [ ] A built-in data structure in Python
- [ ] A way to organize related code into a single unit
- [ ] A compiled binary file that executes Python code
