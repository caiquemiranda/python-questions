51. What does the 'in' operator do in Python when working with dictionaries?

- [ ] Checks if a key exists in the dictionary
- [ ] Checks if a value exists in the dictionary
- [ ] Checks if a key-value pair exists in the dictionary
- [ ] Iterates through the dictionary

---

52. Write a function that takes a dictionary as input and returns a new dictionary with the keys and values swapped (values become keys and keys become values). Assume all values in the original dictionary are unique.

---

53. What is the difference between the `is` and `==` operators in Python?

- [ ] They are identical and can be used interchangeably
- [ ] `is` compares memory addresses while `==` compares values
- [ ] `is` compares values while `==` compares memory addresses
- [ ] `is` only works with integers while `==` works with all data types

54. Create a list comprehension that generates a list of squares of even numbers from 1 to 20.

---

55. What is the output of the following code?
```python
x = [1, 2, 3]
y = x
y.append(4)
print(x)
```

- [ ] [1, 2, 3]
- [ ] [1, 2, 3, 4]
- [ ] [4]
- [ ] Error

56. Write a Python function that takes a string as input and returns a dictionary containing the frequency of each character in the string.

---

57. What is a decorator in Python?

- [ ] A design pattern used to create object-oriented interfaces
- [ ] A function that takes another function and extends its behavior
- [ ] A way to add comments to functions
- [ ] A class that inherits from multiple parent classes

---

58. Create a lambda function that takes two parameters and returns their multiplication.

---

59. What does the `__init__` method do in a Python class?

- [ ] Initializes class variables when an instance is created
- [ ] Destroys the instance when it's no longer needed
- [ ] Inherits attributes from parent classes
- [ ] Defines static methods in a class

60. Write a Python program that uses try/except to handle a ZeroDivisionError when dividing a number by zero.
