81. What is the purpose of Python's `collections` module? Select all that apply.

- [ ] It provides alternative container datatypes beyond the built-in list, dict, set, and tuple
- [ ] It provides utilities for file operations
- [ ] It contains specialized data structures with additional functionality
- [ ] It is used for mathematical calculations

---

82. Write a Python function that uses the `defaultdict` from the `collections` module to count the frequency of words in a given string.

---

83. What is the difference between `threading` and `multiprocessing` modules in Python?

- [ ] `threading` uses multiple CPUs, while `multiprocessing` uses a single CPU
- [ ] `multiprocessing` spawns separate processes, while `threading` creates threads within the same process
- [ ] `threading` is for I/O-bound tasks, while `multiprocessing` is for network operations
- [ ] There is no difference; they are interchangeable

---

84. Create a simple Python script that uses the `datetime` module to get the current date and time, and format it as "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS".

---

85. What is the purpose of the `__init__.py` file in a Python package?

- [ ] It initializes all variables used in the package
- [ ] It indicates to Python that the directory should be treated as a package
- [ ] It contains the main documentation for the package
- [ ] It compiles the Python code into bytecode

---

86. Create a Python class that implements a simple stack data structure with `push`, `pop`, and `peek` methods.

---

87. What is a Python virtual environment and why is it useful?

- [ ] It's a way to run Python code in a web browser
- [ ] It's an isolated environment for Python projects that allows you to manage dependencies separately
- [ ] It's a tool for running Python in a cloud-based environment
- [ ] It's a version of Python that runs on virtual machines only

---

88. Write a Python function that uses the `os` module to list all files in a directory that have a specific file extension.

---

89. What is the purpose of the `__name__ == "__main__"` idiom in Python scripts?

- [ ] It's used to ensure that the code is executed only when the script is run directly, not when imported as a module
- [ ] It checks if the script has the correct name
- [ ] It verifies that the Python interpreter is running the latest version
- [ ] It's a security feature to prevent unauthorized access to the script

---

90. What is the difference between a list and a tuple in Python? Select all that apply.

- [ ] Lists are mutable, while tuples are immutable
- [ ] Tuples use square brackets, while lists use parentheses
- [ ] Lists can contain mixed data types, while tuples cannot
- [ ] Tuples are generally faster than lists for accessing elements
