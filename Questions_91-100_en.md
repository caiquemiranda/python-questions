91. What is the purpose of the `itertools` module in Python? Select all that apply.

- [ ] It provides functions for creating efficient iterators
- [ ] It offers tools for working with iterative functions and generators
- [ ] It's used for mathematical operations on iterables
- [ ] It's used for creating graphical user interfaces

---

92. Write a Python function that uses the `itertools.cycle()` function to create an infinite iterator that cycles through a list of items.

---

93. What is the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in Python and how does it affect multithreading?

- [ ] It's a lock that allows only one thread to execute Python code at a time in a process
- [ ] It's a security feature that prevents code execution from untrusted sources
- [ ] It's a garbage collection mechanism in the Python interpreter
- [ ] It's a data structure that stores global variables across multiple interpreter instances

---

94. Create a Python function that uses the `requests` module to fetch data from a URL and parse the JSON response.

---

95. What is the purpose of `__slots__` in a Python class?

- [ ] To specify which methods are accessible from outside the class
- [ ] To define a fixed set of attributes for instances, reducing memory usage
- [ ] To define class-level constants
- [ ] To specify the order in which methods are executed

---

96. Write a Python program that uses the `argparse` module to create a command-line interface for a simple script that takes two numbers as input and returns their sum.

---

97. What is the difference between `__getattr__` and `__getattribute__` methods in Python classes?

- [ ] `__getattr__` is called when an attribute is accessed, while `__getattribute__` is called when an attribute is set
- [ ] `__getattribute__` is called for every attribute access, while `__getattr__` is called only for attributes that don't exist
- [ ] `__getattr__` works only with instance attributes, while `__getattribute__` works with both instance and class attributes
- [ ] They are the same method with different names for backward compatibility

---

98. Create a Python class that implements the context manager protocol (`__enter__` and `__exit__` methods) to time the execution of a block of code.

---

99. What is monkey patching in Python?

- [ ] A debugging technique to track down bugs in code
- [ ] A way to optimize code execution speed
- [ ] Dynamically modifying a class or module at runtime
- [ ] A method for automatically fixing errors in code

---

100. What is the purpose of the `pathlib` module in Python?

- [ ] It provides an object-oriented interface to file system paths
- [ ] It's used for machine learning path analysis
- [ ] It creates pathways between different Python modules
- [ ] It helps in finding the shortest path in graph algorithms
